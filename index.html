            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The National Football League is an American Football League. It is the
                highest professional level of American football in the world. Miami Dolphins, Houston Texans, and Los
                Angeles Chargers are some of the famous teams. It is a far more physical game than association football
                and thus requires lots of protective gear and equipment. In 2021, the league earned $16 Billion and the
                amount is only expected to rise. Thus the National Football League is the world’s richest and biggest
                sports league.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Indian Premier League</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is the most pleasant surprise any Indian and especially an IPL
                lover can get. Indian Premier League, the brainchild of BCCI, occupies 2nd place in the list of the
                biggest and richest sports leagues in the world. This is incredible, especially when cricket is a major
                sport only in a handful of countries, and out of those, only 3-4 are dominating. This becomes even more
                fascinating when people in Europe or America are not at all aware of cricket. Recently, Viacom18 has
                bagged the digital streaming rights of IPL at a whopping Rs 48390 crore for 5 years. IPL makes a revenue
                of $10 billion in 2022.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Again the American league occupies one of the top spots in list of
                biggest sports leagues. Major League Baseball is a baseball league that is considered the oldest major
                professional sports league in the world. As cricket is famous in India, Baseball is famous in America.
                If you remember, the only All-Star cricket tournament took place in America on the baseball ground
                itself. The league produces $10 Billion per annum which makes it 3rd richest sports league in the world.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">NBA or National Basketball Association is a professional basketball
                league in North America. The NBA is the world’s most prestigious and consists of the richest players
                across the globe. Players like Lebron James, Anthony, and Butler are global icons in the Sports
                Industry. Teams like Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, and Boston Celtics have a worldwide fan
                base. The NBA generates $8 billion yearly as their revenue.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">English Premier League</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The English Premier League or EPL is considered the world’s most
                difficult football league. Unlike Serie A and Bundesliga, in EPL no club can guarantee success. Even a
                club that is at the top of the table for most of the season, can be found in lower places at the end of
                the season. Here the table positions keep on changing and so do the champions each season. The clubs
                have been owned by millionaires and billionaires. Fans do not have any control over the club, as fans in
                Germany have over their different clubs. The clubs in EPL, especially the big ones, are always under
                scrutiny for their expenditure. Well, quite clearly the league has huge revenue, to be precise $5.3
                billion each year.
